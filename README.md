# 🏳️ Simple React Multi Language 🏳️

Hi and welcome to my simple React Multi Language App.
You dont need extra libraries to use this, just have to run:

### `npm install`

To install the dependencies.

#

The functionality is very simple, its based on the use of a global context and json files to store the translations.
